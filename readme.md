
# Overview
In this project, I’m exploring data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, all using Python to display analytics.

### Datasets

The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, who contain randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:
* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type

**Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:**
* Gender
* Birth Year

## How to run it?
Download the csv files for each city: new_york-city.csv, chicago.csv and washington.csv
Download the file project.py 
Place the four files into a same folder. 
Then you can open your terminal into the folder to run the script.


### To make the code interactive, I’ll require some filters from the user, such as:
* City to be analysed.
* The month to be analysed.
* The day to be analysed.
* If raw sample data should be displayed to the user.

### My code provides answers to the following questions:
* The rush hour from the period and city selected.
* The most common user type.
* Gender who rides the most.
* The average age of the riders.
* Total and average trip duration from the period.
* Most frequently used start station.
* Most frequently used end station.
