#### Hello! Welcome to my porfolio. ðŸ‘‹

I'm glad you've come across my page. Within this repository, I share some of the projects I've undertaken, focusing on data analytics and data engineering.
You will find different folders for distinct projects, each unrelated to the others. These projects involve either Python, SQL, or a combination of both.

##### Overview of completed projects:

1. aws_datawarehouse -> This project aims to create a Data Warehouse on AWS.
2. US_bikeshare_analysis -> In this project, Iâ€™m exploring data related to bike share systems in US.
